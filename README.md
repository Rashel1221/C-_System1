## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your Windows system:

| Software | Version | Download Link |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Windows OS** | 10 or 11 | - |
| **SQL Server** | 2021 (or 2019+) | [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) |
| **SSMS** | Latest | [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) |
| **Visual Studio** | 2022 | [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) |
| **.NET Framework** | 4.8.1 | [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481) |
| **Git** | Latest | [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

> 💡 **Note:** SQL Server Express (free edition) is sufficient for development and testing.

### 📥 Installation Guide

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RabindranathChanda/Student_Management_System.git
cd Student_Management_System
```

#### Step 2: Database Setup

**Option A: Import using .bacpac file (Recommended)**

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance
3. In **Object Explorer**, right-click on **Databases**
4. Select **Import Data-tier Application...**
5. Click **Next** in the wizard
6. Browse to `Database/School.bacpac` in the project folder
7. Set database name as: **`School`**
8. Click **Next** and complete the wizard

**Option B: Run SQL scripts manually**

1. In SSMS, create a new database named `School`
2. Navigate to `Database/Schema/` folder
3. Execute scripts in order:
   - `01-tables.sql` – Creates all tables
   - `02-constraints-indexes.sql` – Adds constraints and indexes
   - `Seed/10-minimal-lookup.sql` – Adds lookup data

**Verify Database Import:**
- Expand the **School** database in Object Explorer
- Confirm that tables are present
- Check sample data if using seed scripts

> ⚠️ **Troubleshooting:** If import fails, ensure SQL Server allows data-tier application imports and you have sufficient permissions.

#### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

1. Open `SMS.sln` in **Visual Studio 2022**
2. Locate connection string in the following files:
   - `DatabaseSetup.cs`
   - Any `*.cs` files that contain `Data Source=` or `SqlConnection`
3. Update the connection string with your SQL Server details:

```csharp
// Standard connection string format for Windows Authentication
"Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=School;Integrated Security=True;"

// Example for local SQL Server Express:
"Data Source=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=School;Integrated Security=True;"

// Example with SQL Server Authentication:
"Data Source=YOUR_SERVER;Initial Catalog=School;User Id=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
```

**Finding Your Server Name:**
- Open SSMS → Look at the server name in the connection dialog
- Common formats: `localhost`, `localhost\SQLEXPRESS`, `.\SQLEXPRESS`, or your machine name

> 🔒 **Security Note:** Never commit real database credentials to the repository. Use placeholders and document how to configure them.

#### Step 4: Build and Run

1. **Restore NuGet Packages:** 
   - Right-click solution → Restore NuGet Packages
   - Or: Tools → NuGet Package Manager → Restore

2. **Build Solution:** 
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + B`
   - Or: Build → Build Solution

3. **Run Application:** 
   - Press `F5`
   - Or: Click the Start button (green play icon)

> ✅ **Success!** If everything is configured correctly, the login/register screen should appear.

### 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **"Cannot connect to database"** | SQL Server not running | Open SQL Server Configuration Manager and start SQL Server service |
| **"Login failed for user"** | Incorrect credentials or authentication mode | Check connection string and SQL Server authentication settings |
| **"Database 'School' does not exist"** | Database not imported | Re-import the `.bacpac` file or run SQL scripts |
| **Build errors** | Missing packages | Restore NuGet packages and ensure .NET Framework 4.8.1 SDK is installed |
| **Missing tables/columns** | Incomplete database import | Drop and re-import the database completely |
| **Application crashes on startup** | Wrong connection string | Verify server name, database name, and credentials |
